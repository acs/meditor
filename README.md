# meditor

**meditor** is a software quality models manager to create, import/export, view and edit
models.


## Description

The goal of this project is to create a web editor and viewer for [software quality models](https://github.com/borisbaldassari/se-quality-models) that are used to show metrics in a meaning way. Also, importers and exporters for the different quality models used in the industry will be implemented so they can be used as models or evolved for the creation of new quality models.

In the initial version the metrics supported will be the [CROSSMINER ones](https://github.com/crossminer/crossminer/tree/dev/web-dashboards/ossmeter-metrics).

Based on the models, visualizations for metrics are generated. In the inital version
Kibana dashoards will be created using [GrimoireLab](http://grimoirelab.github.io/).

```

* Export a model to a GrimoireLab JSON file:

```
meditor/django_meditor $ PYTHONPATH=. meditor/meditor_export.py -f meditor/data/ossmeter_qm_grimoirelab.json --format grimoirelab -m "Default OSSMETER quality model"
